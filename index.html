            <h2>Welcome to my gaming reviews and recomendations as well
                parts for your pc to buy and games for it.
            </h2>
            <p>This is a web papge for everything I review as well as a store for
                and pc parts for you to buy to build your own if you so choose to
                so. I am a very big gamer and a fan of pc's so by making this site
                I hope to make it easier for like minded individuales to try some
                fun games and possibly try to make thier own pc.
            </p>

                        Why make a webiste for this?
                    </strong></dt>
                <dd>Well it makes it easier to show my thought process without rambling
                    infront of a camera all day.
                </dd>

                <dt><strong>
                        Why should we use this website and your reviews?
                    </strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    I'm not saying my website is the best or you should use it as the end
                    all be all source for your purchases. all I'm doing is letting you know
                    what I think and you can use that info for your own conclusions on what
                    to spend your money on.
                </dd>


                <dt><strong>
                        Will you do every part and game?
                    </strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    To put it simply no I'm a single person and like you have very limited income
                    so I'll try to get every game but it will proably take awhile.
